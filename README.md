# What is this package all about?

This package contains all the datsets and the means to analyze them. The main programming languages on the data analysis are Python and R. 

# Let's Get Started!

To start with, make sure you have Python and R installed in your operating system. 

Once you made sure that both programming languages can run under your OS environment, change your directory to the `scripts` directory under the root directory of this package, and execute the scripts as:

```
./the_python_script.py
```

Whereas for R scripts, execute it with the command

```

```

Now you are all set. Enjoy!
